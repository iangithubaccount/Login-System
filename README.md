# Login-System
Simple login system using node.js. Currently there is no logic for an incorrect password/username, so add whatever code you want where I added the comments.

Note: for this to work, you must install mongoDB and set up a table. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:<br>
PORT=<br>
DATABASE_URL=<br>
